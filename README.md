# Stock-analysis
Applying Visual Basic for Applications - VBA for data analysis automation for calculations with stocks during 2017 and 2018 to add even more analytical power to Excel.

## Project Overview
Steve, a recent graduate from a finance career is working with his parents who have decided to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation, a company that makes silicon wafers for solar panels. However, Steve thinks that his parents' funds should be more diversified, so he wants to analyze several green energy stocks, in addition to DAQO stock.

The purpose of this challenge consist editing, or refactoring our module solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information obtained in this module. Then, it will consists in determining whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster.  

Refactoring is a key part of the coding process. In other words, refactoring a code tries to make the code more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read.

### Analysis for 2017

The chart displayed below presents the results of the All Stocks macro that was executed for the year 2017. Several observations can be made from the information provided:

-Overall, the solar energy industry appears to have had a successful year, with many stocks seeing positive returns.
-The top three performers in terms of returns were "DQ", "SEDG", and "ENPH", with gains of 199.4%, 184.5%, and 129.5%, respectively.
-There were only two stocks with negative returns: "AY" with a gain of 8.9%, and "TERP" with a loss of 7.2%.
